## Is a version you need missing?

All supported versions are placed in the [generated](/generated/) folder, so adding a new version is as simple as following these steps:

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/stephendolan/lucky_diff/fork )
1. Check out a new branch (git checkout -b add-version-x-x-x)
1. Run `./script/create_new_version vx.x.x`
1. Add your new version to `src/models/version.cr`
1. Run the server with `lucky dev` and verify the content
1. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add version x.x.x')
1. Push to the branch (git push origin add-version-x-x-x)
1. Create a new Pull Request
1. Once the pull request is merged, manually run the Deploy action
